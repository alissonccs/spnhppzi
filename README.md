# **spnhppzi: Bayesian Modeling of Recurrent Event Data with Zero Inflation and Spatial Correlation**  

The **spnhppzi** package is designed for **modeling recurrent event data** that exhibit **zero inflation and spatial correlation**. It follows a **Bayesian approach**, implementing **hierarchical models** to capture **complex structures** associated with event repetition and spatial dependencies.  

Spatial modeling is based on the **Intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive (ICAR) model**, which efficiently incorporates spatial correlation. Additionally, the package provides **both parametric and semiparametric models**, where **Bernstein polynomials** are used for **modeling the baseline intensity function**. This approach enhances the model's flexibility, making it applicable in scenarios where **purely parametric models may struggle to adequately capture data complexity**.  

## **Data Simulation**  

The **spnhppzi** package also includes **functions for simulating recurrent event data**, using an adaptation of the **SIMREC** package ([Farrington et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v058.i02)). This enables the generation of **spatially correlated recurrent event data**, allowing for **model performance evaluation** and experimentation with different recurrence and spatial dependence scenarios.
