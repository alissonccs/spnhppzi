#Notes
The spnhppzi package is currently undergoing an update to improve usability and documentation. We are simplifying functions and refining the code structure to facilitate its application in various contexts.

This repository contains the code used to generate the results presented in the dissertation "Hierarchical Models for the Analysis of Recurrent Event Data with Zero Inflation and Spatial Correlation." During this update process, some functions may be modified, and the documentation will be revised to provide clearer examples and detailed guidance.

We appreciate your interest in spnhppzi! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me at alisson.ccs2@gmail.com.
